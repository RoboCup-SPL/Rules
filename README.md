# Rules

This repository contains the sources of the rule book for competitions in the [RoboCup Standard Platform League](https://spl.robocup.org).
The main document `SPL-Rules.tex` is automatically compiled and uploaded to https://spl.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/SPL-Rules-master.pdf.
It should be regarded as an insight into the rule book's development process, but not as a normative document.
There is no guarantee that changes made in this version will actually appear in the final rule book.
The official rule book releases can be found on https://spl.robocup.org/downloads under the respective year.

\section{Judgment}
\label{sec:judgment}

The referees are the only persons permitted on the carpeted area (\ie the field and the border area).

\subsection{Head Referee}
\label{sec:head_referee}

The head referee is in charge of the game. Any decision of the head referee is valid. The head referee's decision is final and can not be changed afterwards, even by video proof. There is no discussion about decisions during the game, neither between the assistant referees and the head referee, nor between the audience or the teams and the head referee.

The head referee announces decisions by a clear loud call, and (as required) whistle sound.
The whistle, or where there is no whistle the first verbal word of the referees calls, defines the point in time at which the decision is made.
The referees should make efforts to use consistent and clear calls, and it is preferable for referees to use the calls as specified in these rules.\footnote{The calls specified in these rules are detailed in English. With the agreement of the teams, the referees may use suitable calls in any language. The exception to this are technical challenges that depend on the calls as specified.}
The intention of specifying the referee calls is for clarity and consistency across games.

Where a whistle is required, the head referee first whistles and then announces the reason for the whistle.
The head referee may choose to use any normal sports whistle.
Each whistle sound should be short and not too loud as to interfere with other fields and simultaneous games.
The head referee must \textit{only} sound the whistle in circumstances described in these rules.
There are three circumstances when the whistle is sounded, kick-off~(\cf \cref{sec:kick-off}), a goal~(\cf \cref{sec:goal}), and ending a half of gameplay~(\cf \cref{sec:game_struct}).

The head referee should avoid handling the ball (except for placing a ball for kick-off), and avoid handling the robots.
Their duty is to monitor and adjudicate the game.
The head referee should only handle robots and the ball if absolutely necessary to expedite gameplay or removal of penalized robots, where the assistant referees are otherwise occupied or too far away.

The head referee should be equipped with a suitable referee jersey, whistle, coin, and black or dark-blue socks.

The head referee may decide at any point before or during a game to relocate any objects around the field, or direct persons to another position around the field.

\subsection{Assistant Referees}
\label{sec:assist_referee}
The two assistant referees handle the robots and the ball. They take the robots out when they are penalized, and they put the robots in again. If a team requests to pick up a robot, an assistant referee will pick it up and give it to one of the team members once the head referee approves. An assistant referee will also put the robot back on the field. An assistant referee will also replace the ball when it goes off the field or becomes stuck between a players feet.

The assistant referees can \textit{indicate} violations against the rules committed by robots to the head referee, so that the head referee can decide whether to penalize a certain robot or not. Assistant referees should only enter the field to execute a decision made by the main referee. They should not prevent robots from falling during the game.

The assistant referees should be equipped with a suitable referee jersey, and black or dark-blue socks.

\subsection{GameController Operator}
\label{sec:gameControllerOp}
The operator of the GameController sits at a PC in the technical area.
As with the head referee, the operator should make efforts to use consistent and clear calls.
They will signal any change in the game state to the robots via the wireless as they are announced by the head referee.
Note that for both kick-offs and goals, the moment of whistling is determining, not the verbal announcement of the head referee.
The operator will also inform the assistant referees when a timed penalty is over and a robot has to be placed back on the field.
They should announce events that occur automatically in the GameController due to elapsed time, such as the ball coming into play after a kick-off, penalty kick or free kick, or the state changing from \texttt{ready} to \texttt{set}.
They are also responsible for keeping the time of each half (\ie, they stop the clock after a goal or game stuck, and continues it at the kick-off\footnote{The clock may not be stopped during the preliminaries.}).
They should count aloud the remaining seconds in a half once the time remaining is \qty{5}{\second} or less.
Finally, they should repeat the calls of the head referee to make sure it was heard correctly.

\subsection{Referee--Team Communication}
\label{sec:referee_team_communication}
Both teams send a representative called team captain to the field \qty{10}{\minute} before their match starts. This time should be used to welcome each other, assign team colors (\cf~\cref{sec:team_markers}), choose side and kick-off (\cf~\cref{sec:field_side_and_initial_kickoff}), and discuss match related topics.

During the match only the team captains are allowed to communicate with the head referee. Only the team captains and two more people per team are allowed to stay next to the game controller tables. The rest of the team locates themselves around the other sides of the field if they want to watch the match. This allows the referees easier communication with the team and the game controller operator gets less disturbed.

After the match the teams thank the referees for their duty.

During all phases of the match teams and referees are communicating with respect to each other.

\subsection{Referees During the Match}

The head referee and the assistant referees should wear socks \emph{of black or dark blue color} and avoid reserved colors (white and green) in their leg clothing. They may enter the field in particular situations, \eg, to remove a robot when applying a penalty. They should avoid interfering with the robots as much as possible.

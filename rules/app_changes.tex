\section{Changes From \LastRCYear}

This is a brief non-normative list of rule changes from \LastRCYear to \RCYear:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \texttt{ready} visual signal and the corresponding delay
        also apply to Challenge Shield as well as Champions Cup
        (\cf~\cref{sec:robot_states}).
  \item The \texttt{ready} signal delay is increased to
        \qty{\ReadyDelayTimeChampion}{\second} for Champions Cup and to
        \qty{\ReadyDelayTimeChallenge}{\second} for Challenge Shield
        (\cf~\cref{sec:robot_states}).
  \item The \texttt{Motion in Standby} penalty for falsely detecting the
        \texttt{ready} visual signal now results in a team wide penalty,
        but for a shorter duration (\cf~\cref{sec:motion_in_standby}).
  \item Team communication packets sent during \texttt{standby} now count
        down the team's message budget for the game (\cf~\cref{sec:wireless}).
  \item The kicking team for free kicks in Champions Cup matches is communicated
        via visual referee signal. The GameController no longer shares this
        information in those games (\cf~\cref{sec:free_kick_gesture}).
  \item If a team fails to execute a free kick, the opposing team
        may attempt to score directly (\cf~\cref{sec:indirect_kick_default}).
  \item The indirect kick rules from Champions Cup \LastRCYear~ now applies to Challenge Shield as well.
        Challenge Shield teams have a fallback option available, if they
        are unable to field enough robots (\cf~\cref{sec:indirect_kick_default}).
  \item In special situations where it can't be determined
        which team should have kickoff, neither team gets to play the ball first,
        instead the drop ball rule applies (\cf~\cref{sec:drop_ball_rule}).
  \item Penalties can now be aborted early in case they were
        erroneously assigned by the referee (\cf~\cref{sec:aborting_penalty}).
  \item With the ball stop rule each half of the game can be allowed to last
        a little longer to let the attack situation finish (\cf~\cref{sec:early_stopping}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes From \LastRCYear}

This is a brief non-normative list of rule changes from \LastRCYear to \RCYear:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Teams can be restricted from blocking natural light at the competition (\cf~\cref{sec:lightConditions}).
  \item The transition to \texttt{ready} state is announced via visual referee signal in the \texttt{visual} state and the signal of the GameController is delayed (\cf~\cref{sec:robot_states}). The penalty ``Forbidden Motion in Visual'' was added (\cf~\cref{sec:motion_in_visual}).
  \item The rules regarding direct kick goals were tightened for Champions Cup matches. More dynamic ball handling is required to score goals (\cf~\cref{sec:indirect_kick_champions}).
  \item Global Game Stuck was changed with regards of choosing the team that receives kick-off (\cf~\cref{sec:game_stuck:global}).
  \item The Standard Removal Penalty was simplified. Robots will be placed behind the touchline facing towards the field, while penalized, and autonomously re-enter the game without requiring additional intervention from the referees (\cf~\cref{sec:removal_penalty}).
  \item Player stance was clarified and the allowed duration is increased (\cf~\cref{sec:player_stance}).
\end{itemize}

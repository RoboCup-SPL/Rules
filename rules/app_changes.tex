\section{Changes From \LastRCYear}
This is a brief non-normative list of rule changes from \LastRCYear to \RCYear.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The maximum number of players on each team is now 5 or 7 depending on the competition rules (\cf~\cref{sec:robot_players}). RoboCup \RCYear will use 7 players in the champions cup and 5 players in the challenge shield (\cf~\cref{sec:cc_and_cs}).
  \item Various changes related to jerseys (\cf~\cref{sec:robot_players}).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Introduced a bigger allowed range for jersey numbers (\cf~\cref{sec:robot_players}).
    \item The requirements for jersey designs were relaxed (\cf~\cref{sec:team_markers}).
    \item Team colors are chosen before the game and not determined by the schedule anymore (\cf~\cref{sec:team_markers}).
    \item The goalkeeper must wear a different jersey color than the field players now (\cf~\cref{sec:team_markers,sec:goalkeeper}). \textbf{Most teams will have to manufacture at least one new jersey for their goalkeeper}.
    \item \textbf{The goalkeeper isn't required to use jersey number 1 anymore} (\cf~\cref{sec:goalkeeper}).
  \end{itemize}
  \item The content structure of wireless team communication is not specified anymore. A team message is now defined as any UDP packet with up to \qty{\TeamMessageSize}{\byte} payload on the team's assigned UDP port (\cf~\cref{sec:wireless}).
  \item The maximum send rate of GameController return packets has been limited to \qty{2}{\per\second} (\cf~\cref{sec:wireless}).
  \item First kick-off and the goals attacked in the first half are determined by coin toss (\cf~\cref{sec:field_side_and_initial_kickoff}).
  \item The kick-off does not need to be indirect, neither for the attacking nor the defending team (\cf~\cref{sec:indirect_kick,sec:kick-off}).
  \item During kick-off, the number of players of the attacking team in the part of the center circle that is in the own half is not limited anymore (\cf~\cref{sec:kick-off}).
  \item The number of attackers in the penalty area is not limited anymore, and the number of defenders is only limited in the goal area (\cf~\cref{sec:illegal_positioning}).
  \item The goalkeeper may play the ball with its arms/hands, deliberately fall, and push while chasing or looking at the ball within its own penalty area, not only the goal area (\cf~\cref{sec:fallenrobots,sec:hand_ball}).
  \item All teams must release source code after RoboCup (\cf~\cref{sec:source_code_releases}).
\end{itemize}

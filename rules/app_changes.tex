\section{Changes From \LastRCYear}

This is a brief non-normative list of rule changes from \LastRCYear to \RCYear:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Teams can be restricted from blocking natural light at the competition (\cf~\cref{sec:lightConditions}).
  \item The Standard Removal Penalty was simplified. Robots will face towards the field while penalized (\cf~\cref{sec:removal_penalty}).
  \item The start of the \texttt{ready} state is announced via visual referee signal. The announcement of the \texttt{ready} via GameController is delayed (\cf~\cref{sec:robot_states}).

  % uncomment this after the relevant pull request is merged and add the cref.
  % \item The rules regarding direct kick goals were tightened for Champions Cup matches. More dynamic ball handling is required to score goals (\cf~\cref{sec:TODO}). 
\end{itemize}

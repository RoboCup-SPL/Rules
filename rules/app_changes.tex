\section{Changes From \LastRCYear}

This is a brief non-normative list of rule changes from \LastRCYear to \RCYear:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Teams can be restricted from blocking natural light at the competition (\cf~\cref{sec:lightConditions}).
  \item The Standard Removal Penalty was simplified. Robots will be placed behind the touchline facing towards the field, while penalized (\cf~\cref{sec:removal_penalty}).
  \item The transition from the \texttt{initial} to \texttt{ready} state is announced via visual referee signal and the signal of the GameController is delayed (\cf~\cref{sec:robot_states}).
  \item The rules regarding direct kick goals were tightened for Champions Cup matches. More dynamic ball handling is required to score goals (\cf~\cref{sec:indirect_kick_champions}). 
\end{itemize}
